# DeDocs

**DeDocs** is a decentralized document management system that keeps the tracks of the documents using the on-chain history and keeps the documents in encrypted form which provides safety and security. 

## How it works

DeDocs allows the uers to request for the adminstrators of some selected departments to issue a new document or modify the existing documents. All of the actions are performed on-chain. This keeps the integrity of the entire process and prevents any third party influence. Users acan also manage their documents in the application by downloading it and so on.
